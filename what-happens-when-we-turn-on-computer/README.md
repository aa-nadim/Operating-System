Power Supply Activation:
-
Pressing the power button sends a signal to the power supply unit (PSU) to start providing power to the computer's components.

Motherboard Initialization:
-
The power is then distributed to the motherboard, which is the central circuit board of the computer.
The motherboard initializes various components, including the Central Processing Unit (CPU), Random Access Memory (RAM), and other essential peripherals.

CPU Activation:
-
The CPU is signaled to start executing instructions. The CPU is responsible for processing data and managing the overall operation of the computer.

BIOS/UEFI Boot:
-
The Basic Input/Output System (BIOS) or Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) is activated.
The BIOS/UEFI performs a Power-On Self-Test (POST) to check if essential hardware components are functioning correctly.

Storage Device Initialization:
-
The BIOS/UEFI locates and initializes the storage devices (like hard drives or SSDs) that contain the operating system and other essential files.

Boot Loader Execution:
-
The BIOS/UEFI hands over control to the operating system's boot loader, which is a small program responsible for loading the operating system into the computer's memory.

Operating System Loading:
-
The operating system kernel is loaded into memory, and the system transitions from a pre-boot environment to the full operating system.

User Login:
-
If a password or user login is required, the operating system prompts the user to log in.

Desktop Environment:
-
Once logged in, the desktop environment or user interface is loaded, and the computer is ready for user interaction.

Startup Programs:
-
Some programs configured to start with the operating system might also launch, depending on the user's settings.
