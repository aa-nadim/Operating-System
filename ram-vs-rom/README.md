# RAM vs ROM

# RAM (Random Access Memory):

Volatility:

Volatile memory, loses data when power is turned off.
Read/Write Access:

Allows both read and write operations during the computer's operation.
Purpose:

Used for temporary storage of data actively processed by the CPU.
Types:

Includes Dynamic RAM (DRAM) and Static RAM (SRAM).
Speed:

Faster access times compared to ROM, optimized for quick data retrieval.
Usage Examples:

Holds the operating system, application programs, and active data during computer operation.

# ROM (Read-Only Memory):

Volatility:

Non-volatile memory, retains data even when power is turned off.
Read/Write Access:

Typically read-only during normal operation; users can't modify data.
Purpose:

Used for permanent storage of essential system instructions and data.
Types:

Includes Mask ROM, Programmable ROM, and Erasable Programmable ROM.
Speed:

Slower access times compared to RAM, optimized for stable, long-term storage.
Usage Examples:

Contains BIOS or UEFI firmware, bootloader, and critical system instructions needed for computer boot-up.
